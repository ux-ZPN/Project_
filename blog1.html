    <h2>My First Blog</h2>
    <P>This is the first paragraph of my blog post. I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you all. In this post, I will be talking about my day.<br>
        Let's start with my morning. I woke up early and had a cup of coffee. Then, I decided to go for a walk in the park. It was a beautiful sunny day, and the birds were singing. I saw many people walking their dogs and children playing. It wars very refreshing.
